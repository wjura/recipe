Preparation:

Mash cooked potatoes. They should be still warm because it's easier to mash them.

Put mashed potatoes in the bowl and spread them evenly. Divide them into even 4 parts by drawing an X.

Took out for a moment 1/4 of the potatoes, and pour potato starch in the empty spot until it even out the level of potatoes. Put back removed 1/4 of the potatoes into the bowl. Add an egg and salt. Mix everything very thoroughly.

Start boiling water in the big pot, you can add a bit of salt to the water.

Go back to the mixed dough, take a small portion, and form it into a ball size of a walnut. Optionally, you can add a small hole in the ball (like in the picture above) to keep the sauce in the dumpling.

When you finish rolling the dumplings, you can add them to the boiling water. Probably not all at once, it depends on how big is your pot.

Wait about 3 minutes after they start floating, and move them to the plate.
